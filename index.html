            with the help of <cite>Python Crash Course</cite> by Eric Matthes, and I would
            like to advance in it such as Web-Scraping, Back-End Development.

        <p>
            Around the months of October, 2022 - Present, I've been learning HTML & CSS as 
            a personal interest with the help of <cite>HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</cite> by Jon Duckett. I've learnt about basic HTML such as tables, headings, 
            and other topics. I would like to advance in Front-End Development with the
